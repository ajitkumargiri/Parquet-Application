End-to-End Integration Test Automation Documentation

Step 1: Project Setup

Begin by creating a new project or incorporating test modules into an existing Spring Boot project.

Step 2: Test Dependencies

Add the necessary dependencies to your project, including:

spring-boot-starter-test for Spring Boot testing support.
karate for Karate DSL (if you're using Karate for API testing).
Other relevant dependencies aligned with your application's technology stack.
Step 3: Test Data Preparation

Prepare the initial state of your application or database to ensure consistent test conditions. Use Spring @TestConfiguration or other suitable mechanisms to provide test-specific configurations.

Step 4: Cucumber Feature Files

Create Cucumber feature files that encompass scenarios describing the end-to-end test cases. Employ Gherkin syntax to draft human-readable scenarios.

Step 5: Karate Step Definitions (If Using Karate)

Compose Karate step definitions to map Gherkin steps to Java code. Configure Karate to conduct API calls, engage with your application, and validate responses.

Step 6: Spring Boot Test Configuration

Adapt your Spring Boot application for testing purposes. You may need to employ a dedicated test configuration or profiles for specific components (e.g., using an H2 in-memory database instead of the production database).

Step 7: Test Runner

Develop a test runner class annotated with @RunWith(Cucumber.class) to execute the Cucumber tests. Configure the runner to specify the location of your feature files and step definitions.

Step 8: Execute Tests

Execute your end-to-end integration tests employing your chosen build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle) or a suitable integrated development environment (IDE). Keep a vigilant eye on the test execution for potential failures and scrutinize comprehensive test reports.

Step 9: Assertions and Validation

Conduct thorough validation and assertion procedures to ensure the application functions correctly and produces expected outcomes. Here are specific validation steps:

SQL Server Database Validation:

Data Retrieval: Use SQL queries or your preferred ORM framework to fetch data from the SQL Server database.
Data Comparison: Compare the retrieved data with the expected data or data submitted during the test.
Data Integrity: Verify the integrity of data by checking for constraints and relationships.
Transaction Validation: Confirm transactions are correctly committed and rolled back on failure.
Performance and Scalability: Assess the performance and scalability of the SQL Server database.
Security and Permissions: Ensure that the application can access data it's authorized to access.
Cosmos DB Validation:

Document Retrieval: Use Cosmos DB SDK/API to retrieve documents.
Document Comparison: Compare the retrieved documents with the expected data.
Partition Key Validation: Ensure correct partition key usage.
Consistency Levels: Validate chosen consistency levels align with application requirements.
Performance and Throughput: Monitor request units (RUs) consumption and adjust throughput settings.
Indexing: Verify indexing strategy supports query performance.
Security and Authorization: Confirm access control policies and security measures are correctly configured.
Partitioning and Scaling: Ensure Cosmos DB scales dynamically and is optimized for data distribution and query efficiency.
Step 10: Test Cleanup

Implement cleanup procedures, such as resetting the database to its original state or disassembling any temporary resources created during the test.

Step 11: Reporting

Generate test reports that encompass details regarding test results, encompassing both passed and failed scenarios.

Step 12: CI/CD Integration

Seamlessly integrate your end-to-end integration tests into your Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to enable automatic test execution with every code deployment.

Step 13: Test Maintenance

Regularly review and update your tests to accommodate changes within the application and extend your test suite to encompass new test cases as features evolve.

Step 14: Documentation

Document the end-to-end integration testing process, including details regarding the structure of your feature files, step definitions, and any distinctive configurations. Provide illustrative examples of Gherkin scenarios and Karate step definitions. Distribute the documentation among your development and testing teams for reference and collaboration.

Step 15: Best Practices

When developing your test automation, consider and apply best practices. This may include crafting descriptive step definitions, making use of test data factories, and maintaining an organized project structure.
