Certainly! Here's an expanded description of the steps involved in processing the large TXT files, joining employee records, and sorting them based on employee type, using Azure Storage for both input and output.

1. Data Ingestion and Preparation:

Load TXT files containing 20 million records each and employee files (core data and address) from Azure Storage.
Use appropriate libraries or methods to efficiently read and prepare the data for processing in Azure Databricks.
2. Data Transformation and Joining:

Utilize Azure Databricks' distributed processing capabilities to transform and combine the employee files to create a unified dataset.
Perform data transformations, filtering, and joining based on employee ID (empno) to consolidate core and address information.
3. Serialization and Custom Sorting:

Serialize the unified employee dataset into JSON or AVRO format for optimized storage and further processing.
Implement a custom sort function that prioritizes non-manager employees before managers, ensuring the desired sorting order.
4. Chunking and Output File Generation:

Divide the sorted employee dataset into chunks based on a suitable chunk size (e.g., 1 million records per file).
Generate separate output JSON/AVRO files for each chunk, each containing the ordered employee records.
5. Azure Storage Integration:

Utilize Azure Storage for both input and output:
Input: Access the TXT and employee files from Azure Storage to Azure Databricks.
Output: Store the generated output files in Azure Storage for further access and processing.
6. Output File Organization and Naming Conventions:

Organize the output files in Azure Storage with a structured folder hierarchy:
Output Root Folder: output_data/
Subfolders (based on date or identifier):
2023-08-17/
2023-08-18/
Within each date folder, store the chunked and sorted files:
employee_data_chunk_1.json
employee_data_chunk_2.json
...
7. Benefits of the Design:

Leveraging Azure Databricks for distributed processing enhances performance and scalability.
Custom sorting ensures the desired order of employee types in the output files.
Utilizing Azure Storage facilitates efficient input and output operations.
8. Development Considerations:

Optimize Azure Databricks cluster settings for resource allocation and performance.
Monitor and fine-tune the pipeline for optimal processing and resource utilization.
This detailed step-by-step description outlines the approach for processing large TXT files, joining employee records, sorting by employee type, and generating output files using Azure Storage for both input and output aspects of the process. Customize the steps and parameters as needed for your specific project requirements.
