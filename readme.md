Description:

Summary:
We have decided to implement Azure App Service as the solution to handle the continuous API calls for our project. This choice is based on the considerations of our application's complexity, scalability needs, and the requirement for a controlled runtime environment.

Details:

Use Case: We have an API that will be called approximately 500,000 times per day continuously. The API involves complex business logic, interactions with databases, and potentially long-running processes.

Solution Selection: After careful evaluation, we have chosen Azure App Service as the ideal solution for our scenario due to the following reasons:

Azure App Service provides a controlled runtime environment suitable for applications with complex business logic.
It supports multiple programming languages and frameworks, offering flexibility in development.
With appropriate scaling configurations, we can handle the expected load and scale up if necessary.
Advantages:

We will have more control over the execution environment compared to a serverless solution.
It allows us to seamlessly host both APIs and web components, giving us the flexibility to expand if needed.
We can optimize the application for performance by configuring scaling rules, auto-scaling, and load balancing.
Implementation Steps:

Review and optimize the existing API codebase for performance.
Scale up the existing Azure App Service Plan to accommodate the increased load.
Implement caching mechanisms using Azure Cache for Redis or Azure Blob Storage to improve response times.
Set up load balancing for multiple instances to distribute incoming API requests efficiently.
Implement auto-scaling rules based on metrics such as CPU usage to handle traffic spikes.
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Regularly monitor performance using Azure Application Insights to track health and performance metrics.
Continuously analyze usage patterns and adjust resources as needed for cost optimization.
Implement backup and recovery strategies to ensure data integrity and availability.
Outcome:
By implementing Azure App Service, we expect to efficiently handle the continuous API calls, maintain control over the runtime environment, and optimize performance to provide a seamless user experience.
