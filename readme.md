End-to-End Integration Test Automation Documentation

Step 1: Create a New API Testing Project

Begin by creating a new Spring Boot project dedicated to API testing using Cucumber and Karate. This project should be separate from our main application project to ensure clean separation.

Step 2: Test Dependencies

In our test project, add the necessary dependencies, including the following:
Frameworks and libraries suitable for API testing and end-to-end integration testing (e.g., Spring Boot, Cucumber, Karate).
Libraries or tools specific to the java and azure for interacting with APIs and azure resources.
 
Step 3: Test Data Preparation

Prepare test data tailored to the specific environments you'll be testing (e.g., development, testing, staging). Ensure that our test data is isolated from the production environment.

Step 4: Environment Configuration

Configure our test project to connect to the target environment (e.g., dev, test, et) for both API testing and end-to-end integration testing. Ensure that our tests interact with the correct environment's API endpoints, databases, and data. Avoid any interactions with the production environment.

Step 5: API Testing Scenarios

Define test scenarios that cover various aspects of API functionality for our application, such as endpoint testing, request and response validation, error handling, and authentication tests. Make sure these tests are relevant to the specific environment you are testing.

Step 6: Test Execution

Execute our API tests and end-to-end integration tests within the designated environment (e.g., dev, test, staging). Ensure that these tests do not impact or interact with the production environment. This is essential to prevent unintended consequences in a live system.

Step 9: Assertions and Validation

Conduct thorough validation and assertion procedures to ensure the application functions correctly and produces expected outcomes. Here are specific validation steps:

Response Status Codes: Confirm that the API returns the expected HTTP status codes in the target environment.
Response Data: Validate the content of API responses to ensure they match the expected data for the specific environment being tested.
Error Handling: Verify that the API correctly handles and reports errors, providing clear error messages or status codes.

SQL Server Database Validation:

Data Retrieval: Use SQL queries or your preferred ORM framework to fetch data from the SQL Server database. 
Data Comparison: Compare the retrieved data with the expected data or data submitted during the test. 
Data Integrity: Verify the integrity of data by checking for constraints and relationships. 
Transaction Validation: Confirm transactions are correctly committed and rolled back on failure. 
Performance and Scalability: Assess the performance and scalability of the SQL Server database. Security and Permissions: Ensure that the application can access data it's authorized to access. Cosmos DB Validation:

Document Retrieval: Use Cosmos DB SDK/API to retrieve documents. Document Comparison: Compare the retrieved documents with the expected data. Partition Key Validation: Ensure correct partition key usage. Consistency Levels: Validate chosen consistency levels align with application requirements. Performance and Throughput: Monitor request units (RUs) consumption and adjust throughput settings. Indexing: Verify indexing strategy supports query performance. Security and Authorization: Confirm access control policies and security measures are correctly configured. Partitioning and Scaling: Ensure Cosmos DB scales dynamically and is optimized for data distribution and query efficiency. Step 10: Test Cleanup

Implement cleanup procedures, such as resetting the database to its original state or disassembling any temporary resources created during the test.
Step 8: Test Reports

Generate comprehensive test reports that provide information about the test results in the environment being tested (e.g., dev, test, staging). These reports should not contain any information related to the production environment.

Step 9: CI/CD Integration

Integrate our API tests and end-to-end integration tests into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Ensure that these tests are automatically executed in the designated environment with each code deployment while avoiding any impact on the production environment.

Step 10: Test Maintenance

Regularly review and update our API tests and end-to-end integration tests to adapt to changes in the application or the test environments. Add new test cases as features evolve.

End-to-End Integration Test Automation Documentation for Kafka Event Listener Application

Step 1: Project Setup

Begin by creating a new project for your Kafka event listener application or add test modules to an existing project.

Step 2: Test Dependencies

Add the necessary dependencies to your project, including:

Testing frameworks and libraries suitable for your chosen programming language and Kafka integration.
Kafka testing libraries, such as EmbeddedKafka for local Kafka testing.
Any specific dependencies related to your application's technology stack.
Step 3: Test Data Preparation

Prepare the initial state for your Kafka topics and any required data stores. Ensure that the Kafka topics contain messages relevant to your test cases.

Step 4: Test Scenarios Definition

Define test scenarios that cover various event listener functionalities. These scenarios should align with the behavior you expect from the Kafka event listener.

Step 5: Kafka Producer (Simulator)

Develop or configure a Kafka producer simulator that can send messages to the Kafka topics your listener application is subscribed to. This simulator will be used to produce messages that trigger event handling in your application during testing.

Step 6: Listener Test Configuration

Configure your Kafka event listener application for testing. You may need to adjust application properties or configurations for testing purposes, such as using a test Kafka broker.

Step 7: Test Runner

Create a test runner class that triggers your Kafka event listener application and allows it to consume messages from the test Kafka topics.

Step 8: Message Validation

After your Kafka event listener application processes messages, implement validation steps:

Validate that the application correctly consumes and processes messages from the Kafka topics.
Ensure the application reacts as expected to different message types and scenarios.
Verify that the application performs necessary actions or produces expected outcomes as a result of event handling.
Step 9: Error Handling

Integrate error handling tests to validate that your Kafka event listener application correctly handles and logs errors when unexpected or erroneous messages are encountered.

Step 10: Performance and Scalability

Test the performance and scalability of your Kafka event listener by sending a large volume of messages to the Kafka topics and measuring the application's response time, resource consumption, and scalability.

Step 11: Reporting

Generate comprehensive test reports that provide information about passed and failed test scenarios, error logs, and performance metrics.

Step 12: CI/CD Integration

Integrate your Kafka event listener integration tests into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that tests are automatically executed with each code deployment.

Step 13: Test Maintenance

Regularly review and update your tests to adapt to changes in the Kafka event listener application and add new test cases as features evolve.

Step 14: Documentation

Document the end-to-end integration testing process for your Kafka event listener application, including details about setting up the Kafka producer simulator, configuring test scenarios, and any unique configurations.

Step 15: Best Practices

Consider best practices for test automation, such as clear and descriptive test scenarios, logging of test results and errors, and using the appropriate Kafka testing tools.
