Store the chunks in Azure Storage (OutputStorage) using a structured folder hierarchy.

Folder Structure and Naming Conventions: Chunking and Storage

Output Root Folder in Azure Storage:

Root Folder: output_data/
Subfolders (Based on Date or Identifier):

Subfolders are created based on a date or an identifier to facilitate organization and retrieval. For example:
Subfolder 1: output_data/2023-08-17/
Subfolder 2: output_data/2023-08-18/
Chunked and Sorted Files within Subfolders:

Each subfolder contains chunked and sorted Avro files.
Chunked files are named using a consistent naming convention:
Format: employee_chunk_001.avro, employee_chunk_002.avro, ...
Example Usage:

Suppose we have two subfolders under the root output_data:

Subfolder 2023-08-17:

output_data/2023-08-17/employee_chunk_001.avro
output_data/2023-08-17/employee_chunk_002.avro
Subfolder 2023-08-18:

output_data/2023-08-18/employee_chunk_001.avro
output_data/2023-08-18/employee_chunk_002.avro
