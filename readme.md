Introduction

1.1 Overview This Test Strategy Document outlines the approach and guidelines for testing a Java Spring Boot application deployed in Azure, interfacing with Kafka, and utilizing SQL Server and Cosmos DB. It encompasses various types of testing to ensure the reliability, performance, security, and usability of the application.

Scope and Limitations

2.1 Scope The testing scope covers all aspects of the Java Spring Boot application, including individual components, interactions between components, system functionality, usability, performance, security, installation/configuration, and documentation verification.

Testing Approach

3.1 Scope The testing approach encompasses the following types of testing:

3.2 Test Types Unit Testing

Objective: To test individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they work as intended.
Example: Testing a Java Spring Boot application's service layer method that retrieves user data from a database.

Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Java Testing Framework: JUnit or TestNG Mocking Framework: Mockito

Integration Testing Objective: To test the interactions between different components or modules.
Example: Testing the integration between the Spring Boot application's REST API and the database to ensure data retrieval and storage work seamlessly.

Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Java Testing Framework: JUnit or TestNG Integration Testing Tools: Spring Boot Test, TestContainers (for Docker-based database integration)

System Testing Objective: To test the entire system's functionality to ensure it meets requirements and behaves as expected.
Example: Testing a web application's end-to-end functionality, including user registration, login, profile management, and data retrieval.

Tech Stack:

Automation Testing Framework: Selenium WebDriver Test Management: TestRail or JIRA Continuous Integration: Jenkins or CircleCI

Acceptance Testing Objective: To validate that the software meets business requirements and user expectations.
Example: Testing a mobile app's user interface and functionality to ensure it aligns with the design and meets user stories.

Tech Stack:

Automation Testing Framework: Appium (for mobile apps) or Cypress (for web apps) Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Tools: Cucumber or SpecFlow Version Control Integration: Git/GitHub

Performance Testing Objective: To evaluate the application's performance and scalability under different load conditions.
Example: Conducting load testing on an e-commerce website to ensure it can handle a large number of concurrent users during a holiday sale.

Tech Stack:

Performance Testing Tools: Apache JMeter or Gatling Monitoring and Profiling: New Relic or AppDynamics Cloud Scaling: AWS Auto Scaling (for scalable cloud environments)

Security Testing Objective: To identify and address security vulnerabilities and ensure the application is protected against threats.
Example: Conducting penetration testing on a banking application to uncover potential security weaknesses, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

Tech Stack:

Security Testing Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Nessus Ethical Hacking Expertise Secure Coding Practices

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Objective: To have end-users validate the software in a production-like environment to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.
Example: Inviting actual customers to test a new feature in a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform before its official release.

Tech Stack:

Collaboration Tools: Confluence or Microsoft Teams for test documentation and feedback collection User Feedback Platforms

Regression Testing Objective: To ensure that new changes or updates do not break existing functionality.
Example: Re-running a suite of automated tests on an application after a software update to verify that previously working features remain intact.

Tech Stack:

Automation Testing Framework: When it comes to automation testing for a Spring Boot application using Cucumber. CI/CD Integration for automated regression test execution

Smoke Testing Objective: To perform a quick check of critical functionalities to ensure the application is stable enough for further testing.
Example: Running basic tests like application startup and login to quickly identify showstopper issues.

Tech Stack:

Automation Testing Framework: May use the same tools as earlier testing phases (e.g., Selenium, JUnit) CI/CD Integration for automated smoke test execution

Exploratory Testing Objective: To uncover unexpected issues and defects through ad-hoc testing and exploration.
Example: Testers exploring a web application's user interface to identify usability issues, missing error handling, or edge cases not covered by scripted tests.

Tech Stack:

Manual Testing Issue Tracking: Azure devops




============================================================

Creating a test strategy for an application that processes a large volume of data like 12 million records can be a challenging task. It's essential to balance comprehensive testing with practicality and efficiency. Here's a suggested test strategy for your Azure Databricks application, along with considerations for test data:

Test Strategy:

Test Objectives:
Clearly define the objectives of your testing effort. In this case, you want to ensure that the application correctly processes various employee records and creates a single Employee Avro JSON file.

Functional Testing:
Identify 12 to 15 functional test cases that cover different aspects of the application's behavior. These could include scenarios like data validation, record merging, error handling, and data transformation.

Data Volume Testing:
While you may not need all 12 million records for functional testing, consider running a subset of records that represents a range of scenarios, including edge cases. For data volume testing, create test cases that specifically focus on the application's performance and scalability when dealing with large datasets. Test with progressively larger datasets to determine system limits.

Data Validation:
Implement data validation checks to ensure that the output Avro JSON file contains accurate and complete data. Verify that the merged data matches the expected output based on the source files.

Data Transformation:
Test the data transformation logic to ensure that employee records are correctly merged from separate files into a single format. Verify that data types, field mappings, and any transformations are applied accurately.

Error Handling:
Create test cases to simulate error conditions, such as missing files, incomplete data, or corrupted records. Verify that the application handles errors gracefully and provides appropriate error messages or logs.

Performance Testing:
Perform performance testing to assess how the application scales with different data volumes. You may use tools like Apache JMeter or Databricks' built-in performance testing features. Identify any bottlenecks and optimize the application as needed.

Regression Testing:
As you make changes and enhancements to the application, ensure that existing functionality continues to work correctly by conducting regression testing.

End-to-End Testing:
Conduct end-to-end testing to verify that the entire data processing pipeline, from data ingestion to Avro JSON file creation, works as expected.

Monitoring and Logging:
Implement monitoring and logging within the application to track its behavior and performance in different scenarios.
Data Privacy and Security:
If employee data includes sensitive information, ensure that proper data privacy and security measures are in place.
Test Data: For test data, you can consider the following approaches:

Subset of Records:

Given the large volume of data, it's impractical to use all 12 million records for functional testing. Select a subset of records that covers various scenarios and edge cases. This subset should be representative of the entire dataset. Synthetic Data:

For some test scenarios, especially those related to error handling and data transformation, you can use synthetic data that is specifically designed to trigger certain conditions. Synthetic data allows you to create controlled scenarios for testing.

Sampling:

Randomly sample a portion of the data for certain tests. This approach can be particularly useful for performance testing and assessing how the application handles randomness.

Data Generation Scripts:

Develop scripts or programs that generate test data programmatically. These scripts should create data that aligns with your test cases and expected scenarios.

Data Subset Extraction:

If your source data is already organized by categories (e.g., by department), extract a representative subset of records from each category.

Data Masking and Privacy:

Ensure that any sensitive or confidential data is anonymized or masked to protect privacy and comply with data protection regulations.
