Certainly! Here's an expanded description of the steps involved in processing the large TXT files, joining employee records, and sorting them based on employee type, using Azure Storage for both input and output.

1. Data Ingestion and Preparation:

Load TXT files containing 20 million records each and employee files (core data and address) from Azure Storage.
Use appropriate libraries or methods to efficiently read and prepare the data for processing in Azure Databricks.
2. Data Transformation and Joining:

Utilize Azure Databricks' distributed processing capabilities to transform and combine the employee files to create a unified dataset.
Perform data transformations, filtering, and joining based on employee ID (empno) to consolidate core and address information.
3. Serialization and Custom Sorting:

Serialize the unified employee dataset into JSON or AVRO format for optimized storage and further processing.
Implement a custom sort function that prioritizes non-manager employees before managers, ensuring the desired sorting order.
4. Chunking and Output File Generation:

Divide the sorted employee dataset into chunks based on a suitable chunk size (e.g., 1 million records per file).
Generate separate output JSON/AVRO files for each chunk, each containing the ordered employee records.
5. Azure Storage Integration:

Utilize Azure Storage for both input and output:
Input: Access the TXT and employee files from Azure Storage to Azure Databricks.
Output: Store the generated output files in Azure Storage for further access and processing.
6. Output File Organization and Naming Conventions:

Organize the output files in Azure Storage with a structured folder hierarchy:
Output Root Folder: output_data/
Subfolders (based on date or identifier):
2023-08-17/
2023-08-18/
Within each date folder, store the chunked and sorted files:
employee_data_chunk_1.json
employee_data_chunk_2.json
...
7. Benefits of the Design:

Leveraging Azure Databricks for distributed processing enhances performance and scalability.
Custom sorting ensures the desired order of employee types in the output files.
Utilizing Azure Storage facilitates efficient input and output operations.
8. Development Considerations:

Optimize Azure Databricks cluster settings for resource allocation and performance.
Monitor and fine-tune the pipeline for optimal processing and resource utilization.
This detailed step-by-step description outlines the approach for processing large TXT files, joining employee records, sorting by employee type, and generating output files using Azure Storage for both input and output aspects of the process. Customize the steps and parameters as needed for your specific project requirements.





Absolutely, here's a more detailed step-by-step description of the entire process:

1. Data Ingestion and Preparation:

Load TXT files containing 20 million records each and employee files (core data and address) from Azure Storage using appropriate libraries or methods for efficient data retrieval.
Preprocess and clean the data to handle any inconsistencies, missing values, or data quality issues.
Prepare the data for further processing in Azure Databricks by organizing it into suitable data structures.
2. Data Transformation and Joining:

Set up an Azure Databricks environment to leverage its distributed processing capabilities.
Load the employee data from the TXT and employee files into separate DataFrames.
Perform data transformations to convert and shape the data as needed for joining.
Join the DataFrames based on the employee ID (empno) to create a unified employee dataset that combines core and address information.
3. Serialization and Custom Sorting:

Serialize the unified employee dataset into JSON or AVRO format to optimize storage and subsequent processing.
Implement a custom sort function that assigns a priority to each employee based on whether they are a manager or not. This ensures non-managers come before managers in the sorted output.
4. Chunking and Output File Generation:

Divide the sorted employee dataset into chunks based on a suitable chunk size (e.g., 1 million records per file).
Generate separate output JSON/AVRO files for each chunk, ensuring that the sorting order is maintained within each chunk.
5. Azure Storage Integration:

Utilize Azure Storage for both input and output operations.
Access the TXT and employee files from Azure Storage within your Azure Databricks environment to retrieve the initial data.
Store the generated output files in Azure Storage for further access and processing by other components.
6. Output File Organization and Naming Conventions:

Organize the output files in Azure Storage with a structured folder hierarchy to enhance manageability.
Use a root folder, such as "output_data," to contain all output files.
Create subfolders within the root folder, organizing them by date or identifier (e.g., "2023-08-17").
Within each date-based subfolder, store the chunked and sorted output files. Employ consistent naming conventions to facilitate easy identification (e.g., "employee_data_chunk_1.json").
7. Benefits of the Design:

Utilizing Azure Databricks enables efficient and distributed data processing, enhancing performance and scalability.
The custom sorting logic ensures that the desired order of employee types (non-managers before managers) is maintained in the output files.
Leveraging Azure Storage for input and output operations streamlines data handling and storage, contributing to overall efficiency.
8. Development Considerations:

Optimize the Azure Databricks cluster settings to ensure appropriate resource allocation, taking into account the size of the data and the complexity of processing.
Monitor the pipeline's performance and resource utilization, fine-tuning configurations as necessary to achieve optimal processing efficiency.
This detailed breakdown provides a comprehensive overview of the steps and considerations involved in processing large TXT files, joining employee records, custom sorting, and generating organized output files using Azure Storage. Adapt and refine these steps based on your specific project requirements and technical environment.
