million records for each solution, let’s estimate the resources and cost components for Databricks, Azure Batch, ADF, Cosmos DB, SQL Server, and Azure Storage. The assumptions will include approximate processing time, data size, and the resources required for the process.

Assumptions:
Data Size: Assuming the COBOL file size is 1 TB for 10 million records.
Processing Time:
Transformation and loading take 4 hours.
Data transfer time depends on size and speed (e.g., 2 GB/min for network transfers).
Storage: Final processed data is ~500 GB (compressed data in Cosmos DB and SQL Server).
Resource Utilization: Scaled resources for one-time processing.
Solution 1: Azure Batch + Databricks
Cost Breakdown:

Azure Databricks:
Cluster: Standard cluster (4 nodes, 16 cores total) for transformation.
Cost: 4 DBUs/node x $0.3/DBU/hour x 4 hours = $19.20.
Azure Batch:
VM pool: 10 Standard D2s v3 VMs (8 GB RAM, 2 cores) for 4 hours.
Cost: 10 VMs x $0.096/hour x 4 hours = $3.84.
Azure Storage:
Input data (1 TB): Hot tier storage (~$0.018/GB/month).
Cost: 1 TB x $0.018 = $18.00.
Cosmos DB:
Throughput: 50,000 RUs for 1 hour (short burst).
Cost: 50,000 RUs x $0.008/hour = $0.40.
SQL Server:
Standard tier: Compute + storage.
Cost: $0.20/GB for 500 GB = $100.00.
ADF Triggering:
Pipeline cost: Single pipeline trigger for the batch job.
Cost: ~$0.0025 = Negligible.
Total Estimated Cost for Solution 1: $141.44

Solution 2: Azure Data Factory (ADF) + Databricks
Cost Breakdown:

Azure Databricks:
Same cluster and time as above.
Cost: $19.20.
Azure Data Factory:
Data flow activity: Processing 1 TB input file.
Cost: 4 hours x $0.25/hour x 4 = $1.00.
Data movement: 1 TB x $0.25/GB = $250.00.
Azure Storage:
Same as above.
Cost: $18.00.
Cosmos DB:
Same as above.
Cost: $0.40.
SQL Server:
Same as above.
Cost: $100.00.
Total Estimated Cost for Solution 2: $388.60

Solution 3: Databricks End-to-End
Cost Breakdown:

Azure Databricks:
Larger cluster for full processing (6 nodes, 24 cores).
Processing time: ~6 hours (end-to-end).
Cost: 6 DBUs/node x $0.3/DBU/hour x 6 hours = $32.40.
Azure Storage:
Same as above.
Cost: $18.00.
Cosmos DB:
Throughput: Higher RUs for direct data ingestion (100,000 RUs for 1 hour).
Cost: 100,000 RUs x $0.008/hour = $0.80.
SQL Server:
Same as above.
Cost: $100.00.
Total Estimated Cost for Solution 3: $151.20

Comparison Table
Component	Solution 1: Batch + Databricks	Solution 2: ADF + Databricks	Solution 3: Databricks End-to-End
Databricks	$19.20	$19.20	$32.40
Azure Batch/ADF	$3.84	$251.00	N/A
Azure Storage	$18.00	$18.00	$18.00
Cosmos DB	$0.40	$0.40	$0.80
SQL Server	$100.00	$100.00	$100.00
Total	$141.44	$388.60	$151.20
Recommendation
Solution 1 (Azure Batch + Databricks) is the most cost-effective option for processing 10 million records with balanced resource usage.
Solution 3 (Databricks End-to-End) simplifies the architecture further but costs slightly more due to increased Databricks utilization.
Solution 2 (ADF + Databricks) is significantly more expensive due to ADF’s data movement charges for large files.

I have a java lib to take employee object and return a wrapper object of employee, manager, communication medium , Relationship objects in a single wrapper java object, we are planning to read 11 millions users record from parquet files and call the java lib for transformation to employee  and store employee and manager object in cosmos db and other relationship communication in SQL server in azure.
Prepare very good use case from your side and suggest the best way to do using azure databricks

Here’s a comprehensive use case and an optimized solution for processing 11 million user records using Azure Databricks while leveraging your Java library for transformation and storing results in Cosmos DB and SQL Server:

Use Case: Employee Data Transformation and Storage
Scenario:
You need to process 11 million user records stored in Parquet files, transform them into a complex wrapper object using a Java library, and store different parts of the wrapper in appropriate databases:

Employee and Manager objects → Stored in Azure Cosmos DB.
Relationship and Communication Medium objects → Stored in Azure SQL Server.
Requirements:
High scalability and performance for processing large datasets.
Leveraging your existing Java library for transformation.
Ensuring data consistency between Cosmos DB and SQL Server.
Minimizing operational overhead using a managed, scalable platform.
Solution Using Azure Databricks
Azure Databricks provides a highly scalable and efficient platform for processing massive data. Here's the step-by-step plan:

Step 1: Read Data from Parquet Files
Use Azure Databricks to load 11 million user records from Azure Data Lake Storage or Blob Storage into a DataFrame.
Use the spark.read.parquet method for efficient parallelized reading.
# Example code to read parquet files
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("EmployeeTransformation").getOrCreate()

# Path to Parquet file in Azure Blob or ADLS
data_path = "abfss://<container>@<storage_account>.dfs.core.windows.net/user_records"
employee_df = spark.read.parquet(data_path)
Step 2: Call Java Library for Transformation
Use Databricks' support for JVM-based libraries to integrate your Java library.
The records from the DataFrame can be processed in batches or row-by-row by invoking your Java transformation.
Example of calling Java from PySpark:

# Define UDF to call Java library
from pyspark.sql.functions import udf
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, IntegerType

# Assuming the Java library is packaged as a JAR and available in Databricks cluster
spark.sparkContext.addPyFile("path_to_your_jar_file.jar")

# Use JavaGateway to call the library
def transform_with_java(record):
    from py4j.java_gateway import JavaGateway
    gateway = JavaGateway()
    java_transformer = gateway.entry_point.getTransformer()  # Assuming your lib has an entry point
    return java_transformer.transform(record)

# Register UDF
transform_udf = udf(transform_with_java, <output_schema>)  # Define the output schema

# Apply the transformation
transformed_df = employee_df.withColumn("wrapper", transform_udf(employee_df))
Step 3: Separate and Write to Target Databases
Employee and Manager Objects → Azure Cosmos DB: Use the Azure Cosmos DB Spark Connector to write the transformed Employee and Manager objects.
# Write Employee and Manager data to Cosmos DB
cosmos_config = {
    "spark.cosmos.accountEndpoint": "https://<cosmos-account>.documents.azure.com:443/",
    "spark.cosmos.accountKey": "<cosmos-key>",
    "spark.cosmos.database": "<database-name>",
    "spark.cosmos.container": "<container-name>",
    "spark.cosmos.write.strategy": "ItemOverwrite"
}

employee_manager_df.write.format("cosmos.oltp").options(**cosmos_config).mode("APPEND").save()
Relationship and Communication Medium → Azure SQL Server: Use the JDBC connector to write the data into Azure SQL Server.
# Write to Azure SQL Database
jdbc_url = "jdbc:sqlserver://<sql-server-name>.database.windows.net:1433;database=<db-name>"
properties = {
    "user": "<username>",
    "password": "<password>",
    "driver": "com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver"
}

relationship_comm_df.write.jdbc(url=jdbc_url, table="Relationships", mode="append", properties=properties)
Step 4: Optimize Performance
Batch Processing:

Split the 11 million records into smaller partitions using Spark's repartition() or coalesce() to ensure efficient parallel processing.
employee_df = employee_df.repartition(1000)  # Adjust based on cluster size
Caching:

Cache the transformed DataFrame in memory to avoid repeated computations.
transformed_df.cache()
Cluster Configuration:

Use an appropriately sized Databricks cluster (e.g., autoscaling with enough worker nodes) to handle the data volume.
Integration with Event Hub or Service Bus (Optional):

If real-time or near-real-time processing is needed, consider using Event Hub or Service Bus to trigger Databricks jobs dynamically.
Step 5: Logging and Monitoring
Enable structured logging using Databricks logging utilities to track progress and debug issues.
Use Azure Monitor to collect metrics and logs from Databricks and the databases.
Key Benefits
Scalability: Databricks ensures that the large dataset is processed efficiently, leveraging Spark’s distributed computing.
Cost Optimization: Autoscaling reduces unnecessary costs while handling peak loads effectively.
Seamless Integration: Built-in support for Cosmos DB and Azure SQL ensures easy data storage and consistency.
Reusability: Your Java library is integrated without significant re-engineering.

-- Step 1: Add an ID column
ALTER TABLE Transactions
ADD ID BIGINT IDENTITY(1,1);

-- Step 2: Drop the composite PK
ALTER TABLE Transactions
DROP CONSTRAINT PK_Transactions;

-- Step 3: Add ID as the new PK
ALTER TABLE Transactions
ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Transactions_New PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (ID);
