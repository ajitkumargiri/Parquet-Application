To design the solution around the components you’ve mentioned (Initial Load File Creator, Recalculation Engine, DB Saver, and Error Handler), let's break down each component and how they will function within the ETL pipeline. We'll also highlight their responsibilities and how they interact with each other in the overall architecture.


---

1. Initial Load File Creator

Purpose:
This component is responsible for reading raw data from source systems, transforming it into the required format (Parquet), and storing it into Azure Blob Storage. This step handles the data extraction, file unzipping, and transformation before any downstream processing.

Responsibilities:

File Reading & Extraction:

Read raw data from Azure Blob Storage (flat files and copybook format).

Handle various file formats (e.g., CSV, TXT) and process each file accordingly.


File Unzipping:

Unzip compressed files if they are delivered in a zipped format.


Data Transformation (Pre-Processing):

Convert the data to a more efficient format for processing, such as Parquet (for optimal performance in Spark).

Organize records based on source record types, ensuring proper data classification and ordering.


Data Storage:

Save transformed data into Azure Blob Storage in Parquet format.

Ensure that records are partitioned by party ID to ensure efficient querying and scalability for downstream processing.



Implementation Details:

Technology: Azure Databricks with Spark API.

Key Tools/Functions: dbutils.fs, Spark DataFrame API, Parquet file format.

Error Handling: Any failures in reading, unzipping, or transforming the files will be logged into a centralized error log (e.g., stored in a specific container in Azure Blob Storage).

2. Recalculation Engine

Purpose:
The Recalculation Engine is responsible for applying business rules to the transformed data, ensuring that any derived attributes are recalculated or adjusted according to business logic. This may involve transforming existing data or aggregating new data based on predefined rules.

Responsibilities:

Business Rule Execution:

Apply predefined business logic or transformation rules on the data (e.g., derived attributes, calculations based on other attributes).


Data Transformation:

Process the data to recalculate fields or derive new attributes that are required for downstream reporting or storage.


Data Enrichment (if applicable):

Enrich the data based on related records or external data sources, if required by the business rules.


Error Handling for Business Rule Execution:

If any records fail to process based on business logic, these should be flagged and handled appropriately (e.g., rerouted to a Dead-letter Queue).



Implementation Details:

Technology: Azure Databricks with business logic implemented in the party-model-translator JAR or as Databricks notebooks.

Key Tools/Functions: Invoke JAR or custom notebook functions, Spark transformations, and DataFrame operations.

Error Handling: Log failures during rule execution and flag the problematic records for investigation.

3. DB Saver

Purpose:
This component is responsible for saving the transformed and recalculated data into target databases—Azure Cosmos DB (for NoSQL storage) and SQL Server (for relational storage).

Responsibilities:

Azure Cosmos DB:

Save data into Cosmos DB for fast, scalable, and flexible NoSQL storage.

Ensure data is partitioned appropriately (e.g., by party ID) to optimize for performance.


SQL Server:

Save the data into SQL Server (relational database) for structured storage and transactional queries.

Ensure that data is written in a way that supports querying and reporting (e.g., using appropriate indexing and data normalization).


Data Consistency & Performance:

Ensure that both databases are updated correctly with transformed data and that data consistency is maintained.

Use Databricks connectors for Cosmos DB and SQL Server to facilitate efficient data loading.



Implementation Details:

Technology: Azure Databricks, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Server.

Key Tools/Functions: Use Databricks Connectors for Cosmos DB and SQL Server, leverage batch writes to ensure optimal performance.

Error Handling: If the DB saver fails, log the failure and retry the operation. Ensure that any failed records are tracked and retried until successful.

4. Error Handler

Purpose:
This component is crucial for ensuring that the pipeline can handle errors effectively, log errors appropriately, and ensure that problematic data does not cause the entire pipeline to fail. It will manage retries, dead-letter queues, logging, and alerting.

Responsibilities:

Error Logging:

Track errors that occur during the entire ETL pipeline (e.g., reading files, transforming data, recalculating business rules, loading data into databases).

Log the error details (e.g., error message, file, timestamp) to a centralized logging system (could be Azure Blob Storage or a separate log management system).


Retry Mechanism:

Implement retries for transient failures (e.g., network issues, temporary storage issues).

Define backoff strategies and retry intervals to avoid overwhelming resources.


Dead-letter Queue (DLQ):

Store failed records in a Dead-letter Queue (e.g., another container in Azure Blob Storage or a separate Cosmos DB collection) for further inspection.

Records in the DLQ should be reviewed or manually processed if required.


Alerting & Monitoring:

Set up Azure Monitor alerts to notify the relevant team when errors occur.

Use Databricks built-in monitoring tools to keep track of job failures and trigger alerts based on conditions (e.g., job failure, data inconsistency).



Implementation Details:

Technology: Azure Monitor, Databricks monitoring, Azure Blob Storage (for logs), Cosmos DB (for DLQ), Databricks notebooks for error handling logic.

Key Tools/Functions: dbutils.fs, logging libraries, Azure Monitor for alerting, retry mechanisms within Databricks jobs.

Error Handling: Centralized error logging and custom error handling logic within each pipeline step (Initial Load, Transformation, DB Saver).

Full Pipeline Flow

1. Initial Load File Creator:

Reads data from Azure Blob Storage.

Unzips and transforms the data into Parquet format.

Stores the transformed files in Azure Blob Storage.

If any error occurs, the error handler logs it and retries if needed.



2. Recalculation Engine:

Takes the raw transformed data from Blob Storage.

Applies business rules to recalculate derived attributes.

Logs any errors in the business logic processing and moves failed records to the DLQ for manual inspection.



3. DB Saver:

Loads data into Cosmos DB and SQL Server.

Ensures that the data is partitioned and indexed for optimal performance.

Logs any errors that occur during data loading and retries if possible.



4. Error Handler:

Monitors each stage of the pipeline for errors and failures.

Implements retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues.

Alerts teams when errors occur for quick resolution.

Summary of Components:

1. Initial Load File Creator: Handles reading, unzipping, transforming, and saving raw data to Azure Blob Storage in Parquet format.


2. Recalculation Engine: Applies business rules and recalculates derived attributes using the party-model-translator jar or Databricks notebooks.


3. DB Saver: Saves transformed and recalculated data into Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL) and SQL Server (relational).


4. Error Handler: Ensures that errors are logged, retried, and stored in a dead-letter queue for review. Alerts teams of failure conditions.



This architecture provides a robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant solution for processing large datasets and ensures that issues are handled appropriately at each stage of the pipeline.
