Yes, I understand correctly. The party-model-translator JAR in this solution acts as the core logic library responsible for data transformation and enrichment. It processes raw input data to derive required attributes and prepares it for storage in Azure Blob Storage (Parquet format) and downstream databases (Azure Cosmos DB and SQL Server). Below, I explain the methods that need to be written in the party-model-translator JAR to meet the requirements.

Core Responsibilities of the Party-Model-Translator JAR

1. Data Parsing: Convert raw input data (flat file/copybook formats) into a structured format that Databricks can process.


2. Transformation Logic: Apply business rules to generate or calculate derived attributes based on the raw input.


3. Data Validation: Ensure that input data meets quality requirements (e.g., no nulls in required fields, valid formats).


4. Data Enrichment: Add calculated fields or augment the data with additional business-relevant attributes.


5. Error Handling: Handle any issues during processing and log errors for troubleshooting.

Methods to Include in the Party-Model-Translator JAR

1. parseRawData()

Purpose: To parse raw input data from flat file or copybook formats into a structured data frame or object for processing.

Input: Raw data records (String format or binary if needed).

Output: A structured data model (e.g., a PartyRecord object or a Spark DataFrame).

Steps:

Read the file line by line.

Parse each line based on the schema provided (e.g., copybook schema definitions).

Return the parsed data in a format ready for transformation.



public List<PartyRecord> parseRawData(InputStream rawData) {
    // Implement file reading logic
    // Parse each record based on schema and map it to PartyRecord class
    // Return list of structured PartyRecord objects
}


---

2. transformData()

Purpose: Apply business transformation rules to each parsed record to derive calculated fields or restructure the data.

Input: A list of PartyRecord objects or a Spark DataFrame.

Output: Transformed records with calculated attributes (e.g., OwnershipPercentage, AccountType).

Steps:

Iterate through each record.

Apply business rules logic (e.g., derive ownership percentage, account types, etc.).

Handle conditional updates like recalculating derived attributes when an entity joins or leaves a contract.

Return transformed data.



public List<PartyRecord> transformData(List<PartyRecord> parsedData) {
    // Iterate through each record
    for (PartyRecord record : parsedData) {
        // Apply business rules
        record.setOwnershipPercentage(calculateOwnership(record));
        record.setAccountType(determineAccountType(record));
    }
    return parsedData;
}


---

3. calculateOwnership()

Purpose: Calculate the ownership percentage of an entity in a contract based on specific business rules.

Input: A single PartyRecord object.

Output: Ownership percentage as a double.

Steps:

Use relevant fields (e.g., totalShares, entityShares) to compute ownership.

Implement special cases (e.g., if an entity changes its role, trigger recalculation).



private double calculateOwnership(PartyRecord record) {
    if (record.getTotalShares() > 0) {
        return (double) record.getEntityShares() / record.getTotalShares() * 100;
    }
    return 0.0; // Default if no shares
}


---

4. determineAccountType()

Purpose: Determine the account type of an entity based on predefined conditions (e.g., individual, joint, corporate).

Input: A single PartyRecord object.

Output: Account type as a String.

Steps:

Check specific fields (e.g., isJointAccount, entityType).

Map the values to predefined account types (e.g., "Individual", "Corporate").



private String determineAccountType(PartyRecord record) {
    if (record.isJointAccount()) {
        return "Joint";
    } else if (record.getEntityType().equalsIgnoreCase("Corporate")) {
        return "Corporate";
    }
    return "Individual"; // Default type
}


---

5. validateData()

Purpose: Validate the integrity and quality of the data before proceeding with transformations or storing.

Input: A list of PartyRecord objects.

Output: Validated data and a list of errors (if any).

Steps:

Check for missing required fields.

Validate data formats (e.g., date format, numerical ranges).

Log or collect invalid records for further inspection.



public ValidationResult validateData(List<PartyRecord> records) {
    List<PartyRecord> validRecords = new ArrayList<>();
    List<String> errors = new ArrayList<>();
    
    for (PartyRecord record : records) {
        if (record.getPartyId() == null || record.getPartyId().isEmpty()) {
            errors.add("Missing Party ID in record: " + record);
        } else {
            validRecords.add(record);
        }
    }
    return new ValidationResult(validRecords, errors);
}


---

6. logError()

Purpose: Log errors encountered during parsing, transformation, or validation.

Input: Error details (e.g., exception message, stack trace, record ID).

Output: Error log entry.

Steps:

Write errors to a log file or monitoring system (e.g., Azure Log Analytics).



public void logError(String errorMessage, Exception e) {
    // Log error to a file or external monitoring tool
    System.err.println("Error: " + errorMessage);
    e.printStackTrace();
}


---

7. writeTransformedData()

Purpose: Write the transformed data into the desired format (e.g., Parquet files).

Input: Transformed PartyRecord objects.

Output: Files saved in Parquet format to Azure Blob Storage.

Steps:

Convert the PartyRecord objects into a Spark DataFrame.

Write the DataFrame into Parquet format and store it in Azure Blob Storage.



public void writeTransformedData(Dataset<Row> transformedData, String outputPath) {
    transformedData.write().format("parquet").save(outputPath);
}


---

Key Considerations

1. Performance Optimization:

Ensure the transformation methods can handle large datasets by leveraging parallelism (e.g., Spark).

Avoid redundant operations (e.g., repeatedly calculating derived attributes).



2. Error Handling:

All methods should implement robust exception handling to gracefully handle failures and log errors for debugging.



3. Scalability:

The library must support distributed execution (via Databricks) to handle massive data volumes.



4. Reusability:

The JAR should be modular to allow reuse across different workflows.
